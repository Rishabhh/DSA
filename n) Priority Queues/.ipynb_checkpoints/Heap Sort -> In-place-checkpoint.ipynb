    "   \n",
    "    Step-1 : Create a min-heap from the unsorted array. (Each insertion take logn time, hence for n items nlogn time)\n",
    "    Step-2 : Then remove elements one at a time from the heap and store them in the given sorted array. (Each removal also takes logn time , so for n elements it will take nlogn time\n",

    "    Step-1 : Build a MIN HEAP - Create IN-PLACE heap within the unsorted array. Go to each element of array and                    UP-heapify to create   MIN-HEAP with them\n",
    "    Step-1* : With this, MIN-HEAP is achieved within the array : Time Complexity : nlogn\n",
    "    Step-2 : Interchange the min-element from the 0th index to last of the array and heapify-down leaving the last element.\n",
    "    Step-2* : This places the minimum element in the last of the array\n",
    "    Step-3 : Repeat step-2 once down-heapify of 2nd-step is done. Time Complexity : nlogn\n",
    "    Step-3* : This will provide us with a reverse sorted array. Reverse the array or use MAX-HEAP from beginning instead of MIN-HEAP\n",

    "    Step-2 : Start from (n//2 -1) index as it is the last Non-Leaf Node and Down-heapify (for MIN-HEAP) each               Non-leaf node. Doing this gives us a MIN-HEAP i.e. you need not heapify complete array to get Min-Heap\n",
